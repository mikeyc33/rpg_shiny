## What is R Shiny (cont.)

* In advanced settings, Shiny can be used to build complex applications which allow users to model, visualize, and input/download data

* Shiny integrates well with R's extensive visualization libraries (i.e. ggvis, leaflet, RgoogleVis) to create customizable visualizations
